<br> Tokyo Toy Show (Makuhari Messe)
<br> 14:00 - 14:50
<p>
At 14:00, the hostess came out on stage and gave a brief introduction of the game. 
Then, the END music of Startling Odyssey II was played as background music, 
and Inoue-san came out on stage.
<p>
Inoue has her hair in fluffy curls and her attire is a long black and white dress. The body part was black and the frilly skirt was white. It was very beautiful. She clutched a hankerchief in her hand. Inoue said "Hello!".
<p>
People were told "no cameras or videotaping", but there we quite a few people who ignored them and took pictures.
<p>
Then the host introduced Inoue, Elektra for Nadia, Kasumi Tendo from Ranma 1/2, etc., as well as many voices from foreign movies.
<p>
There was a lot of talk about the game, but I couldn't keep up with it. Inoue-san played Julia in Startling Odyssey II.
<p>
"When I read the script for Startling Odyssey II, I knew it would be absolutely fascinating."
<p>
"I enjoyed some of the funny ad-libs that some of the guys would do."
<p>
"The lead actor is Kazuhiko Inoue. People always ask me if we are brother and sister."
<p>
"I performed with Daredare Dare and Yuri Amano. I had a lot of fun with them."
<br>
# I did not catch the name of the other voice actor.
<p>
She said that the END song for Startling Odyssey II was composed with Julia's feeling in mind. The hostess also said that a CD containing the END song would be released at the same time as the game.
<br>
# I couldn't catch the name of the song. (;_;)
<p>
Then Inoue sang the song. It was so hot that during the interlude, Inoue turned around and wiped her face with a handkerchief.
<p>
The hostess came back to the stage and asked us not to use the camera flash. Inoue-san nodded, but the flashes did not stop.
<p>
Then we went into the question and answer section. Four questions were prepared from the survey.
<p>
Q: When did you know that you were a fish in a previous life?
<br>
A: Ever since I was a child, I wondered why swimming in the ocean was so easy, so pleasant, and so happy. I was always wondering why swimming in the sea made me feel comfortable and happy. During the summer vacation of my second year in high school, I was swimming in the sea and suddenly I had a memory of the past. I am not sure if it was a sunfish, but I am sure it was a fish. There was a photo weekly magazine about a mambo incident(???) and people were talking about mambos. I saw a photo of a man stepping on a sunfish in a photo magazine, and tears started to stream down my face, so I guess it was a sunfish.
<p>
Q: Do you play the games in which you appear?
<br>
A: I had never played the game before. But I decided to play. I thought it would be very interesting. I was afraid that once I started, I wouldn't be able to stop. I had to work tomorrow, so I decided to play for 5 or 10 minutes, and it went by in about 2 hours, and I really enjoyed it. When my voice would come out, I would clap my hands and say, "Oh, there it is!"
<p>
Q: What was the most powerful scene in Startling Odyssey II?
<br>
A: The ending is quite shocking. To impress the people who had it done...
<p>
Q: What are your future plans?
<br>
A: My next album is coming out in September. I thought I would have one in my lifetime, but the second ... The project for the next album is still a bit of a secret, but I have a plan that will surprise you a bit... I'm working on a karaoke project right now. We are taking music orchestration at one of the studios today. I hope you look forward to it. Also, there will be a video following the album.
<p>
At that time, someone took out a CD and Inoue said "Thank you very much."
<p>
The presenter then said that a CD single of "Okaerinasai (Welcome Home)" would be released on 6/17.
<p>
Inoue-san: "Okaerinasai" is NHK's image song for Montana Jones. The other song is "Jolly Osakana". The first album was "Graceful Osakana", so this time it is a Latin version.
<p>
Then Inoue sang "Okaerinasai". (about 3 minutes and 30 seconds)
<p>
When the song was over, Inoue-san called out "Thank you very much." When the MC arrived on stage, Inoue-san said "I made a mistake. I made a mistake."
<p>
Then it was on to the gift corner. The first one was an autograph card. Kikko-san took out the questionnaires one by one from the box. After taking the first questionnaire, the host asked, "What is the number?" and Kikko looked at the form and asked, "Well.... Where is it written?"
<br>
# The number was written in small letters in the upper right corner of the survey form.
<p>
She found the number and said "Number 45". Then 7, "A lucky number... number 100. I can't read your name... Excuse me.", then 6, 4, 37, and 20.
<br>
Then it became posters (signed); 21, 50, 16 (not present), 19, 12, and 22.
<br>
Then it became a video. On the case of the video is the signature of Inoue; 85 (not present), "This is Ishii-san, number 65. Congratulations.", 60, and 47.
<br>
Then cards (postcard sets?) that were also signed; 79, 81, 8, 99, 9 (not present), 24, 30 (not present), 44, 24, 30 (not here), and 44.
<br>
Then it became a game (Starbreaker). It was signed on the CD case of the game; 60, "Doi-san, number 87. Congratulations. Over there. And, the last one... I'm thrilled to say.. number 11."
<p>
Then the gift corner came to an end.
<p>
Inoue's last message:
<p>
<blockquote>
Thank you all for gathering here today. I really enjoy working on games. It's fun to hear my own voice, and I'd be very happy if I could meet you all in the game. We are all having a lot of fun, so please give it a try. If you have any comments or impressions, please send them to me. I can't play the game at all yet, so I would be happy if you could tell me how I can do it better. Thank you very much.
</blockquote>
Then Inoue-san was about to leave the stage. However, the person in the middle of the front row half climbed up on stage and handed a huge (the same size as a poster) photo to Inoue.
