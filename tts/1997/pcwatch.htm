<CENTER><h2>Weekend Summary - '97/3/21 Edition</h2></CENTER>


 The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970320000000/http://www.fjt.co.jp/~toyshow/">'97 Tokyo Toy Show</a>is being held at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970320000000/http://www.bigsight.or.jp/index_main.html">Tokyo Big Sight</a> at Ariake. Open to the public on the 22nd and 23rd, admission is 1,000 yen. Since the exhibition is mainly toy-related, there will be few PC or game-related products, but here is a look at the show, focusing on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970320000000/http://www.bandai.co.jp/">Bandai</a>'s "Tamagotchi"-related products.<p>

<b>Bandai booth</b><br>
 A large "Tamagotchi"-shaped display was set up in front of the entrance to showcase the new products "Tenshi no Tamagotchi," "Discover in the Forest! Tamagotchi", and "Discover Tamagotchi in the Sea! Tamagotchi" are being demonstrated. Also on display are a number of related products, including the PHS "Tamapitch" with built-in "Tamagotchi" functions, the "Tamagotchi CD-ROM," and the "Tamagotchi" print club.<br>
ã€€The "Tamagotchi CD-ROM" can be seen in action on a PC. The attendant explained that "while the computer is turned off, the 'Tamagotchi' is sleeping". There was a long line at the Print Club. If you really want to try it, it is better to get in line early. Unfortunately, it seems that "Tamagotchi" and related goods will not be sold.<p>
 Software for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation were also on display, including a demonstration of motion capture using "Dragon Ball" characters.<p>
