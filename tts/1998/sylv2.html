There was a video playing in the middle and the Sylvanians seemed to be having some fun conversation. Am I the only one who thinks that there should be a TV program using Sylvanians?<BR>When I was watching NHK's morning educational TV, I found that stories for children using miniature dolls (such as "Paddington", which is now a present from Nabisco, and "Nyakki", which is drawn with clay - this is the best.) are quite interesting and I think they would be popular with children.<BR>
In a separate video for vendors, he also introduced the Sylvania Friends Association, which currently has 70,000 members. He also explained that the telephone service receives 30,000 calls per month.<BR>
Also posted are the airing times of the commercials, and it appears that Sylvania will be shown during the "Doraemon" program (19:00 on Fridays, I believe).<BR>

It is really fun to have so many Sylvanians. I wish I could make such a diorama at home. (How much money does it cost?)

I was told that I would see her at the toy show tomorrow, so I went to the reception desk and asked for the person in charge.<P>

He was a nice person and had visited our website several times, so we got to talking and found out that we had been giving away gifts on our website, that we were an original goods agency, and to our surprise, he knew about Martika. They seemed to like our website very much, and yesterday many of them visited it together with us, and everyone seemed to be very pleased with it. (Really?).<P>

I was also introduced to a great person in charge of marketing, and we talked about various home page copyright issues.<BR>
The person said, "As far as I can see from your website, there are no problems at the moment, so you can continue." Sylvania's website is not damaging to Epoch, but on the contrary, it is good for advertising. (^o^)/<BR>
I received a reply that they have not yet sorted out how to handle this internally on the Internet, so I will get back to you with a formal response after next Monday.<BR>
I think it is a relief for the time being that everyone seems to like our website very much.<P>
